		<p>hnCommentWatcher: yet another bookmarklet <a href="https://github.com/christopherdebeer/hnCommentWatcher">(https://github.com/christopherdebeer/hnCommentWatcher)</a></p>

		<p>I'm one of <s>those</s> many people that <s>enjoy</s> procratinate-by reading Hacker News. So in a helpless attempt to be <s>productive</s> efficient I've created hnCommentWatcher. Yet another HN bookmarklet. Currently I swear by @mrspeakers Hackemup bookmarklet [1], it really is brilliant, but its only for the front page, an I still find it painful to follow the comment threads for each post (which I belive I get the most use out of Hacker News). So <strong>hnCommentWatcher</strong> is my solution.</p>
		<p><strong>What it does:</strong></p>
		<p>hnCommentWatcher is a bookmarklet that you use on individual posts/threads, which then refreshes the page every so often and indicates which comments are new, and allows you to easily navigate between them, meaning you can open a thread read the comments then come back later and follow the discussion without having to decifer which comments are new and which you've already read.</p>
		<p><strong>How to use it:</strong></p>
		<p>Drag this bookmarklet: <a href="javascript:(function(){window.hncBase='https://github.com/christopherdebeer/hnCommentWatcher/raw/master/';var%20a=document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0],b=document.createElement('script');b.type='text/javascript';b.src=hncBase+'hnCW.js?'+Math.floor(Math.random()*99999);a.appendChild(b);})();%20void%200" id="bookmarklet">nCommentWatcher</a> to your bookmarks/favorites bar/folder, and click on it when you're on a post you want it to watch for you.</p>
		<p>Also if you're inpaitient and you dont want to wait for its internal time to tick over just click the bookmarklet again to update right away.</p>

		<h2>Examples</h2>
		<p><strong>OP</strong></p>
		<p>OP (the original poster) is highlighted on each comment they make. this makes it easier to see what the person who posted the link to HN has contributed to the thread. The Image below is an example of how it would be styled/indicated.</p>

		<p><strong>New Comments</strong></p>
		<p>New comments are displayed in green (see example below). and the first new comment is scrolled into view by default. If there are > 1 new comments then each will have a button at the bottom linking to the next new comment, to make navigation easier.</p>

		<p><strong>Newish comments</strong></p>
		<p>When the page is reloaded by hnCommentWatcher comments that were new are marked in light green (see example below) for a short period before reverting to unstyled, this is so that when there is an update and you may not have read all the new comments in time, its easy to locate/identify "Newish" comments.</p>
